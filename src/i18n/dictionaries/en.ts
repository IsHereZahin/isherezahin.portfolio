My childhood was spent in the calm of the village, where ponds are part of everyday life. We had one at my grandfather’s house, and I used to bathe there all the time. My uncles tried to teach me to swim, but I was always scared. One afternoon, while my grandmother was washing clothes by the pond, I ran and jumped in like I always did it. But that day, I landed in the deep middle of the pond. I was shocked. I remembered the moves my uncles had shown me, I applyed thats tricks, and somehow made it back to the edge, gasping but alive. Then so many times I swim in the open sea at Cox’s Bazar. The point is, nothing’s really impossible, you just need that one brave moment to try.",
